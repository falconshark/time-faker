# Time Faker

![Preview Image](https://i.imgur.com/lNbd9b1.png)

A tool for generate fixed / random timestamp with specified time range.

Currently, it had random and fixed mode.

Fixed mode is such like generate the timestamp between 2024/08/06 - 2024/08/07, every 10:00 - 18:00;
And in random mode, all of the timestamp will be randrom in these date and time range.

## So, when will it be useful?
When you need to input some testing data which is meeted the time range.
For example, if you need to input some fake clock in and clock out data, I think it will be useful.

## Roadmap
Most of the function is completed, but should add the setting for the result number of random mode.
